This is an experimental media MOQ relay (AKA: CDN node) based on [MOQT](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-moq-transport/). It can be used in conjunction with following live encoder and player [moq-encoder-player](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/moq-encoder-player). Both repos allows us create a live streaming platform where we can control latency and quality (and others), so we can test scenarios from ultra low latency live (video call) to high quality (and high scale) live.

In the following figure you can see an overview of the relay architecture

Fig2: Relay architecture overview

## Installation

- Just execute (probably you will need `sudo` unless you run it like `root`):
```
./build.sh
```

## Test preconditions
- Generate self signed certificate for the server applications
```
cd scripts
./create-server-certs.sh
```

### Test with date server

- Execute date server (from project root dir)
```
./_build/bin/moqdateserver -port 4433 -cert ./certs/certificate.pem -key ./certs/certificate.key --logging DBG
```

- Execute text client
```
./_build/bin/moqtextclient --connect_url "https://localhost:4433/moq-date" --track_namespace "moq-date" --track_name "/date"
```

- You should see an output like:
```

## Test with media client
- You can use [moq-encoder-player](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/moq-encoder-player) as encoder (publisher), and also as player (consumer)

- You need to install that website ([moq-encoder-player](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/moq-encoder-player)) in a https server (apache2 recommended)
   - It will requiere to enable cross origin isolation (see [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76077439/enabling-cross-origin-isolation-on-the-apache2-web-server)) on the player side

- To start the relay you can do (from project root dir)
```
./_build/bin/moqrelayserver -port 4433 -cert ./certs/certificate.pem -key ./certs/certificate.key -endpoint "/moq" --logging DBG
```

## Local test with media client (server running in localhost)

- Execute (from project root dir)
```
./_build/bin/moqrelayserver -port 4433 -cert [moq-encoder-player]/certs/certificate.pem -key [moq-encoder-player]/certs/certificate.key -endpoint "/moq" --logging DBG
```

Note: [moq-encoder-player] indicate the root directory of that project. So you need to use those certs to enable connections from Chrome to localhost

- Start client (MACOS)
Run MOQ encoder / player locally
   - Open a Chrome window and follow the instructions you will find in [moq-encoder-player](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/moq-encoder-player)
